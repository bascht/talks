* My Talks

This is a (non-comprehensive) list of talks I gave at various user
groups & conferences. If you have any questions, feel free to reach
out for me via a GitHub issue in this repo.

** Found license issues & copyright violations?
I tried my best to keep the original licenses and give credit to
original authors. If you miss photos from a Talk I gave, that probably
means that I couldn't find the author of the image or give proper
attribution.

If you find photos / images / text content in this repository that
violates intellectual property, please notify me at ~github dot com at
bascht dot com~ and I will take it down.
